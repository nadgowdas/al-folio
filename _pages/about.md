I love playing tennis, cricket and watching bastketball, americal football. According to my wife, I cook great spicy Indian dishes :). I do like to travel and explore. 


In my spare time  I take pride in designing and developing large scale distributed secure systems and more importantly driving research innovations that brings differentiating capabilities to make cloud more secure. My current area of research includes Supply Chain Security, DevSecOps, Developer Tools, Security and Compliance for Containers.
