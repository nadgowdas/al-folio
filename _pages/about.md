I love playing tennis, cricket and watching bastketball, americal football. According to my wife, I cook great spicy Indian dishes :). I do like to travel and explore. 


In my spare time  I take pride in designing and developing large scale distributed systems and more importantly driving research innovations that brings differentiating capabilities to the cloud. My current area of research includes DevSecOps, Developer Tools, Containers and Cloud Security.
