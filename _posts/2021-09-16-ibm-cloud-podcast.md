In this recent IBM Cloud  podcast, I had a  great time talking  to Dan around  the topic that is near and dear  to my heart, i.e. DevSecOps and Supply Chain Security. As I mentioned in this talk, Supply Chain Security is becoming important because our reliance on the open-source ecosystem is growing. But, in no-way I  am suggesting  we should avoid  use  of open-source software. OSS is must  to  drive innovation and to build our new technologies. But, open-source  does not means its "free". We need to invest in the secure use of these softwares. There were various other topics we touched upon.
