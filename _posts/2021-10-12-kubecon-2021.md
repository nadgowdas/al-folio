This year (2021) I had opportunity to  present at Crossplane community Day at Kubecon'EU  and Cloud Native Security Day at KUbecon'  NA. 

At Crossplane Community Day, me and my colleague Paolo, talked about "role of DevSecOps" in crossplane. I strongly believe as we drive the adoption of crossplane for cloud infrastucture service provisioning and management, DevSecOps or "shift-left" security should be essential part of the solution.

Then, at CloudNative Security Con' co-located with Kubecon'NA at Los Angeles, I had opportunity to present my current research focus around security of our CICD pipeline. This talk really helped me connect with so many wonderful people from the open-source community and drive the  discussion forward.
